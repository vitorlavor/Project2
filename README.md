# Project - Bank Marketing

## 🏦 💰 About the project  

Through a good exploratory data analysis and a machine learning model, this project aimed to increase the campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect the success rate, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time). So, this project aims to answer the following business questions:

1. What is the bank's current subscription rate?
2. What is the model's performance in classifying customer's subscription? 
3. Which customers are more willing to subscribe to the product?
4. Which model is recommend to put into production for the next campaign?

The dataset is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) .
